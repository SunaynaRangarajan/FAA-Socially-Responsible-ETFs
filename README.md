Part of UW CFRM Master's Thesis - Sunayna Rangarajan

The Flexible Asset Allocation (FAA) model was developed by Keller & Putten in 2012. It extends time series momentum model to a more generalized momentum model consisting of four new factors - Absolute momentum (A), Volatility momentum (V) and Correlation momentum (C) apart from traditional relative momentum factor (R).In this paper, each ETF is ranked based on momentum R, volatility V, correlation C and an additional factor - MSCI Total ESG score E to account for the social impact potential of the ETF. This can be defined as:

  â€¢ ESG Score Momentum (E): ESG Score Momentum ranks ETFs in our universe based onthe total MSCI ESG score.
